# 1. Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the vast universe of role-playing games, immersion is essential for an engaging and rewarding experience. Dragon's Dogma, one of the most celebrated titles in this genre, offers a world filled with epic adventures and exciting challenges. However, for players looking for a meticulous organization of their quests and a better understanding of their characters, a dedicated web application could be the key to optimizing the gaming experience. In this context, the idea of a customized To Do List for Dragon's Dogma was born.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine an online platform where players can not only log their missions manually, but also manage them efficiently, categorizing them into those that have already been completed, those that are in progress and those that have yet to be started. In addition, this application goes beyond simple task management, allowing users to view details of their characters within the game.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up, this web application not only offers a convenient way to organize activities within Dragon's Dogma, but also provides players with a more comprehensive and detailed view of their characters, allowing them to delve even deeper into the captivating world of this renowned RPG.
